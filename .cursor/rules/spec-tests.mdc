# Spec Tests Usage Guide

When working with spec tests in this project, follow this pattern:

## Creating Spec Tests

1. Create a module folder in `./specs/`
2. Inside this folder, create YAML file(s) with test cases
3. Each test case should have `path:` and `status:` fields
4. Separate test cases with `---`

## Example Format

```yaml
path: /metrics/activeAddresses?pageSize=2&endTimestamp=1751248800 
status: 200
---
path: /metrics/activeAddresses?pageSize=1
status: 200
---
path: /metrics/activeAddresses?pageSize=9999&endTimestamp=1751248800 
status: 400
```

## Running Spec Tests

After creating the YAML files, run:
```bash
npm run spec:fill
```

This command will populate the specs with data from Glacier.
